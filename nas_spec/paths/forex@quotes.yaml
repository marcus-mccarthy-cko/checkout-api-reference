  description: |
    Request an exchange rate between a source and destination currency pair that will be used to process one or more payouts. You must submit a payout with the FX quote identifier before the quote expires. If the FX quote identifier is omitted from a payout, and the source and destination currencies differ, the current market exchange rate will be used.
